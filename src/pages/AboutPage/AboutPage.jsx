      <p>
        The humble developer of the app before you. I am a lifelong reader and book lover who loves to slip into the thrill of a new fantasy world or the emotional rollercoaster of a romance novel. Some of my favorites reads include The Wheel of Time Series, The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson, and The Book Thief.

      <h2>What is Bookworm?</h2>
      <p>
        Reading doesnâ€™t have to be a solo endeavor. Popular apps in the reading community have failed to bring a social connection between readers which is where bookworm steps in to bridge that gap

      <p>
      Websites and applications that appeal to the reading community have failed to bring a social connection between readers. Although comments, reviews, and occasional discussions under individual book titles are possible the user cannot have a private discussion/chat in app and have to navigate to another platform to properly express themselves. This is where bookworm steps in to bridge that gap and fulfill the need to jump into a heated discussion with friends after getting to the climax of a sci-fi novel.
