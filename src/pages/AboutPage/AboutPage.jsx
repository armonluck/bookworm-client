      <p>Lead Developer</p>
      <p>The humble developer of the app before you. Websites and applications that appeal to the reading community have failed to bring a social connection between readers. Although comments, reviews, and occasional discussions under individual book titles are possible the user cannot have a private discussion/chat in app and have to navigate to another platform to properly express themselves. This is where bookworm steps in to bridge that gap and fulfill the need to jump into a heated discussion with friends after getting to the climax of a sci-fi novel.</p>
